## About

Prismwork is a personal organization / plural system on the Internet:tm:

We make dev utilities, Minecraft mods and more!

## Licensing

The [license](LICENSE) applies to all our projects unless explicitly stated.

#### About Minecraft mods

While the Unlicense is applied to these projects, we still do have concerns about our mods.

Thus, there is an additional term (for now) applied to mods:

- **No unexpected ports.** Our projects are rarely updated due to our schoolwork, but we are unlikely to quit maintaining them for a long foreseeable future. The point is that most mods of ours are on Fabric/Quilt because we are more familiar to the two toolchains. However, we don't wish to see our modding projects being forked and ported to a different loader without explicit permission. We are willing to port by ourselves if we have time, and we are glad to accept generous pull requests to assist our porting, so if you wish to port our projects, do contribute your work to upstream, and we'll declare you as a contributor with gratitude. You are still free to make and distribute any changes other than porting.

#### About other projects

You just do what ~~the fuck~~ you want.
